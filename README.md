# XFCE4-dotfiles
Just my configuration for XFCE

For a preview look at 1.png and 2.png and 3.png in this repo

### Steps
(these r more for me than for u)
1. Download Xfce.
2. Download via aur or by zip files tela-circle-icon-theme-dracula and bibata/rose pine cursors.
3. Also Download Nightfox Duskfox theme by Fausto Korpsvart (https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart/Nightfox-GTK-Theme)
4. Apply all of these via settings.
5. Do remember to get rid of the icons from the desktop if u do wish to do so + apply one of the backgrounds i have provided or one of ur own.
6. Download picom and fastfetch (https://github.com/dacrab/fastfetch-config (where i got my fastfetch config from)).
7. Copy the folders from the .config folderin my repo.
8. Copy the .local folder and change the colorscheme in xfce4-terminal to Catppuccin-Macchiato (https://github.com/catppuccin/xfce4-terminal).
9. Download and change ur shell to fish(which i use)/zsh(which i used to use).
10. Tip: If u use fish try out starship (starship.rs).
11. Edit the panels and all in xfce as u wish.
12. For picom in settings go to window manager tweaks and turn of display compositing and set picom to autostart when u log in.
13. For Zen browser transparency + blur I suggest using Zen Zero by Sameersaw (https://www.sameerasw.com/zen)
14. Log out and log back in for a whole new XFCE!
